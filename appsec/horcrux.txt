	flag = flag{gyg0skBf8tYHfU0X}
	After inspecting the source of webpega I found "<applet code="PacMan.class" width="384" 	height="384" />". I downloaded the file and using GHIDRA I discoverd  = fBlH2S;^\\uCOIPb|A5Yigb
	I also found a function decrString(). Using thing function I decrypt the msg1 and got the 		flag.


RE: 
	I found the /data directory. Then I download the parse binary and with the help o ghidra
	I found the Function that does the checking (FUN_080487f0()). I followed the registers 	that were use to load arguments for FUN_080487f0. It using $ecx and $edx. Then i found what 	values are loaded at ecx and edx at DAT_0804a101 and DAT_0804a107 respectevly.  The function 	does a xor with both values => d2ecede9a6 xor b3888080c8 = 61646d696e => admin (username). For 	the second call of this function it gets the value from DAT_0804a0e0 and DAT_0804a0a0. 	Like befor it xor the 2 values

BLOGOO: 
	After trying a lot of input I found that the valnurability is at the time that we create new user and more specific at the label Username. again after a lot of tries I found that the table that has the record has 6 columns. When I manage to print the table it only printed 5 colmuns, the column of password was missing. So I wrote this command tsutomu' UNION SELECT password,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM users-- - and I manage to shwitch password possition with username possition and now we can see that we have the password of

	couldn't bypass login so I tried to login with some defult username and passwords. it 	works with "admin" as password and username. Then on URL I noticed that we have a uid. I 	change it and noticed that content of webpage is changing. I keep trying until I hit uid 13 	and found the flag.
	
	
Gloria Foster: 
	She played the Oracle in The Matrix (1999) so it's going to be padding oracle attack.
	After google I found different code and tools to do padding oracle and more specific
	https://github.com/GDSSecurity/PadBuster . 
	Then I have to use sudo apt-get install libcrypt-ssleay-perl to make it work. 
	I gave to command the chiper-text 	NynrieZGvMEoBCDxkxwuMwlNLbCJW2k5ALkwOP3yXvtLohn0tQqPlT2WC/UnLeJ/ and the URL http://wolkje-87.cs.vu.nl:63566/EJaqJFVI/cgi-bin/index.php  and it returned me flag.
